<!--- The website is at Software-enthusiast1.github.io -->
This is the first website I have made, you can visit it at `software-enthusiast1.github.io`

I am still learning how to use this platform, so bear with me.

More specificly, I am currently trying to port some code that I already have into a working website, so if you know how to help me, you can reach me at christopher.d.curtis1@gmail.com
